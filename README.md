# password-generator

## Description

This is a JavaScript powered password generator that asks the user to confirm password parameters (would you like upper case? lower case? Include numbers? Special characters?) After the selected conditions are confirmed, the generator will display a randomly generated password according to the user's choices. 

## Installation

No installation required, this is fully accessible in the webbrowser.

## Usage

Navigate the generator by using the buttons. After pressing generate password, you will be given a series of prompts to select the type of password you'd like to make. After your new password has been generated, use the copy to clipboard button to easily paste your new password elsewhere.
